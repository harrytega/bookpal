## 25.01.2 - 2025-01-17
### Changed
* Refactor migration application logic to apply each missing migration individually and to print infos about the migration being applied
* Refactor the cobra cmd setup structure and the flag parsing logic using struct-based flags.
**BREAKING**: The restructuring breaks additionally created subcommands attached to the existing commands. See [Migration Guide Command Restructuring](https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter/wiki/Migration-Guide-Command-Restructuring)
